The following are a list of resources that I've put together from
recommendations in the FidoNet C_Echo.  These include books,
magazines and compiler vendors.

The format for book entries is as follows:

Author _Title_, ISBN, Publisher, Year, List Price (Comments --
  Recommmended-By)

Prices are in $US unless otherwise specified.  Where a book has been
recommended by multiple persons, I've left off the names that don't
have comments.  Books are in alpha order by author's last name, or
title if the author is unknown or unattributed.  When there is more
than one ISBN or price, the following suffixes will be used:

.p -- paperback
.h -- hardback
.d -- with disk

Magazine information includes the name of the magazine and the address
and subscription rates.

I cannot list information I do not have.  It is possible that some
information may be missing for a particular book.  Comments are
condensed from the messages I got the recommendation from and may or may
not accurately describe the book.   Lest they take over C_ECHO, any and
all additions/corrections/suggestions should be sent to me netmail at
1:106/2000.25.

[DISCLAIMER:  I make no promises real or implied as to the usefulness of
any of the books here listed.  The reason for the 'recommended by' is
to give you some idea of who thought the book was good so you can find
books that are recommended by folks whose messages make particular sense
to you.  (Or folks who forgot to mention author/ISBN/publisher/price so
you can harass them.)  These people are not in any position to promise
you anything, either.]

In response to a request by the FidoNet C_Echo moderator, I'm
soliciting longer blurbs about any and all resources listed here.
Please answer the following questions, either individually, or cover
the answers to most of them in a paragraph or so about the book.

a) Title or other information sufficient for me to determine what
   the heck you're writing about
b) When you last read/looked at the book (if it's been a long time,
   I'll need to take that into account when selecting whose comments
   to use)
c) A brief description.
d) A list of subjects where the book should be listed
e) It's target audience (pick one or more of the following:
   beginner, intermediate, skilled, advanced, expert)
f) Your opinion of the useability/readability/understandibilty of
   the book
g) What types of folks you'd recommend it to
h) What types of folks you'd recommend to pass it by

...and anything you think I forgot.

Your cooperation will be appreciated and your name will be listed as
a contributor.
