Welcome to SNIPPETS!

  All the code I put into SNIPPETS for distribution is Public Domain or free
to the best that I can determine. What this means is that:

1.  I know or can contact the original author(s) to verify the presumed
    copyright ownership, and

2.  The work bears an explicit Public Domain notice, or

3.  The work is copyrighted but includes a free use license, or

4.  The work was published without a copyright notice prior to the effective
    date of the new copyright law.

  This has been occasionally annoying when I've had to pass up some useful
piece of code because it's questionable whether anyone can use it without
incurring liability (distributing someone else's property makes me an
accessory, doncha know).

  Since SNIPPETS includes both public domain and free code, be sure to
carefully read each header for any free license restrictions which may
apply.

Distribution:

  Starting with the December 1992 version, SNIPPETS is distributed in two
files:

SNIPmmyy.LZH is the full SNIPPETS collection.
SNPDmmyy.LZH contains only the files changes since the last release.

  SNIPPETS is distributed through the FidoNet Programmer's Distribution
Network (PDN - see the file PDN.LST for a list of PDN sites and further
information. The SNIPPETS files are also available from my "home" BBS, Comm
Port One, (713) 980-9671, FidoNet address 1:106/2000 using the "magic" F'req
names of "SNIPPETS" and "SNIPDIFF". Various Internet mirror sites also carry
SNIPPETS, but I'm not sure which ones have it an any given time. One place to
try is oak.oakland.edu in /pub/msdos/c.
